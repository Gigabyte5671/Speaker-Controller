# Speaker Controller
**Automatically turns my desk speakers on/off when I change the audio output in Windows.**

Well, that's what I'm using this project for anyway. Although, it's essentially just a smart power bar - you can use it to switch any household appliance on/off.

## Circuit
This is a rough diagram of the circuit I'm using to control the speakers:  
![full circuit diagram](./images/circuit-1.svg)

In reality, all of the discreet components are part of [this board](https://www.jaycar.co.nz/arduino-compatible-5v-relay/p/XC4419), and connected to the [Arduino](https://www.jaycar.co.nz/leonardo-tiny-atmega32u4-main-board/p/XC4431) like so:

## Code
### Arduino
Code for the Arduino is located in the [`sketch`](./sketch/) directory.  
This program simply listens for characters being sent by the USB host and toggles the relay's state accordingly. If the program receives a `'1'` the relay is turned on, `'0'` the relay is turned off.


### PC
The script to be run on the connected PC is in the [`controller`](./controller/) directory.  
This script runs in the background, polling the registry for updates to the default audio output device. When the default device changes, it notifies the Arduino.

> [!NOTE]
> You'll need to run `cd controller && npm i` before running this script for the first time.

## Housing
The [`models`](./models/) directory contains some housing models that fit with [my particular power bar](https://www.kmart.co.nz/product/arlec-4-outlet-surge-protected-powerboard-42153580/).

You can also find the [model source on OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/b996f80e98ba7dbd92c3a90e/w/50b2495923acaf03b7d63635/e/e429f6e0665596681b5c2419?renderMode=0&uiState=6615ad4f92329a0588dcb680).

I printed these with eSun White PLA+, and the following settings:
- 0.4mm nozzle
- 0.2mm layer height
- 3 wall layers
- 15% infill density

Fully assembled:  
![The assembled device](./images/pic-1-small.jpg)

The Arduino and relay are slid into the right side of the housing:  
![Inside the right side of the device](./images/pic-5-small.jpg)

With the cover on, the USB port is accessible from this side of the device:  
![Inside the right side of the device](./images/pic-3-small.jpg)

On the opposite side, the two ends of the live wire are inserted into the screw terminals on the relay board:  
![Inside the left side of the device](./images/pic-4-small.jpg)

The terminals can be tightened down through a small hole in the top of the housing:
